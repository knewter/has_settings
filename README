The has_settings plugin is extremely basic.  It just allows you to easily store a settings hash against any activerecord model.

class SomeClass < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_settings # and that's it, really
end

Make sure to run the plugin migrations.  Also this will only work where Rails Engines is, unless you copy over the model to your app's models dir.
